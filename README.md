# MarkovGenerator
A simple Markov Chain text generator. Only the Python standard library is used, so all data structures and algorithms are implemented from scratch. To extend this project, you could take into account the previous two words (or n words) to learn associations between longer sequences of words (the amount of data needed is exponenial to n). 

Example:

Romeo

So thrive my grief:
To-morrow will murder thee.

Romeo

Alack, there lies more strange, i must confess,
but that hand, that i send me speak at thy company.

Romeo

And i'll no longer be a winged messenger of thee
take all this yielding to myself,
because it be morrow.

Exit above

Romeo

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in night
so stumblest on my soul that vast shore wash'd with grief
