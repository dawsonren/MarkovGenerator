# MarkovGenerator
A simple Markov Chain text generator. Only the Python standard library is used, so all data structures and algorithms are implemented from scratch. To extend this project, you could take into account the previous two words (or n words) to learn associations between longer sequences of words (the amount of data needed is exponenial to n).
